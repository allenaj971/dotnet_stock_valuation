# Stock valuation project
This project is a demonstration of my learnings. I built a stock valuation fullstack application that can:
- Add/Delete stocks
- Add/Update/Delete DCF and DDM models for each stock

## Purpose
- Familiarise myself with developing Web APIs in the Microsoft ASP.NET Core framework.
- Improve my skills in ReactJS
- Learn to connect Web APIs to MSSQL databases
- Learn how to use Docker containers to containerize the MSSQL database
- Improve my git and Github skills
